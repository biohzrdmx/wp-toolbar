# wp-toolbar

Easily toggle the WordPress admin toolbar

## Overview

This plugin allows you to update plugins from a ZIP file easily, using the built-in logic from WordPress but giving you more control over the process.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.x
- PHP 7.1+

## Installation

Clone/download the repo and install the plugin by unziping the contents of the zip into the `wp-content/plugins` folder of your WP installation, rename the resulting folder to `wp-toolbar` and activate it through the WordPress admin dashboard.

Once installed you will see a 'Toolbar' button on the admin toolbar when viewing the site, there you will find a **Hide** command. If you click it, the toolbar will be disabled for the current user and a floating button will be shown in its place.

If the toolbar has been disabled you will se a 'WordPress' floating button on your top-right corner where you will find a **Show toolbar** command; just click it to enable again the admin toolbar for the current user.

As simple as that.
